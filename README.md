# API Documentation

To easily test the API, I have written an OpenAPI documentation, and I have placed it in the root folder of the project.
The file is named API_Documentation.yaml. For testing, you can import it to: https://editor.swagger.io/ or Postman (or any
other client that supports yaml importing)

# Database of choice - MySQL

For this assignment I have chosen to go with a relational database, which is MySQL. Even though I have experiece
with cloud-hosted NoSQL databases such as Firebase, using MySQL on frequent basis has made it much easier for me to work
with it. 

There are advantages and disadvantages to using the both of them, SQL databases are efficient at processing queries 
and joining data across tables, making it easier to perform complex queries against structured data. NoSQL databases 
on the other hand lack consistency and typically require more work to query data, particularly as query complexity increases.
